## STORAGE BASICS

File system storage
block storage
object storage


### physical storage

* Single disk drive
* JBOD
    works on DAS (direct attached storage)
  
* SCSI device (small computer system interface)
  it supports 32 HDD's
  
* Volume

  means basically volume in disks c,d drive kind of
  
*Storage array
* DAS (direct attached storage)


* NAS (Network area storage)

  working on IP protocol
  not designed for very big data transfer
  creates load on processing power
  
* SAN (Storage area network)
  
* iCSI


### storage protocols 

* ISCSI
* FC (Fibre channel over ethernet)
* NFS

* RAID
* Storage access
* File organization

# Why we use TAPE ??


## Storage Hierarchy

Cache
main memory
flash memory
magnetic disk
optical disk
magnetic tapes


## IOPS = Disk read write speed

SATA  is interface 

(Serial AT Attachment)
7200 RPM 72 I/O OPS
interface speed to transfer data 6gbps speed
SATA is used in HDD

NLSAS (Serial-Attached SCSI solid-state drive)
used in high performance server  
10k rotation per  min

###hotswap :
feature which we allow to change disk during runnning server 

## Disk failure
Mean time to failure (MTTF) - average time the disk is expected to run continuesly without failure
typically 3-5 years
MTTF decreases as disk ages.
